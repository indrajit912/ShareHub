# ShareHub

ShareHub is a Flask web application designed to facilitate easy file sharing across different devices. Users can upload files to the app, which are then locally saved on the server. This allows users to access and download their files from anywhere on the internet, making it a convenient solution for scenarios such as sharing files between different devices or accessing files needed for printing.
